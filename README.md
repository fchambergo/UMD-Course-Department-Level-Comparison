# UMD-Course-Department-Level-Comparison
Done in Python: This is a personal project but also a final class project for an information science class at the University of Maryland

This project uses the RESTful UMD API (https://umd.io/) to gather undergraduate course information on the course departments available at the University of Maryland. This implements a graphic user interface to select two departments and compares the number level of 100, 200, 300 and 400 level courses between the two in bar graph. The bar graph is produced with the use of numpy and matplotlib. 

The user has the choice to list the classes of both departments.

The entire code was made by scratch alongside with a custom scratch made banner implemented in the GUI. The banner was made by myself in Adobe Photoshop.
